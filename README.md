# URLs_Monitor

This little R script helped me monitor our websites and links to some of our key data platforms to quickly get notified in case of a down time. I get a notification in my Slack less than 5 minutes after a link is down and get updates when it's back online. The down-time logs are also logged for troubleshooting by the IT team and retrospective analysis when needed.
